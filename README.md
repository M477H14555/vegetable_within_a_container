# vegetable within a container

This piece of code that I made was a game of psychology about a carrot in a box.

## The gist

The gist of te game is simple, get the box with the carrot inside. 

You must have two players to play this game. Name yourselves 1 and 2 and we shall begin.

## The instructions

Person 2 turns around. 
Person 1

[TBC]
