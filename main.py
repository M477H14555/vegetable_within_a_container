description = '''\n########## Carrot in the box instructions ##########

This is a bluffing game where you and your opponent tries to select the box with the carrot inside of it.
Only one box has a carrot inside of it. To win, you must choose the box with the carrot inside of it. 

This is a simple game of persuasion and betrayal.

- Player one looks in their box whilst the opponent closes their eyes.
- Player one then says that their box has/hasn't got the carrot inside. (Player 1 can choose either)
- Player two then decides to swap or keep the boxes.
